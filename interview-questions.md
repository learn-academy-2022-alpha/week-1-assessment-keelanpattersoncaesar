# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a version control software. It lets multiple developers work on projects without putting said projects in jeopardy. Github is just a way to manage your project's "code history" in the cloud.

  Researched answer: Git is a software use to track changes (think snapshots) to assist teams of developers during software development. Github is a cloud-based way to manage your repositories.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The JS operators that will return a Boolean value are <, >, =, <=, and >=.

  Researched answer: The following operators will all return a Boolean Value: <, >, ==, ===, <=, and >=.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the actual position something has in an array. Value is the actual value that thing holds.

  Researched answer: The index is the location, while the value is what is stored there.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is code that will loop until the end of the code

  Researched answer: An iteration is when your code repeats a task until the condition is no longer met. Each time it repeats is called an iteration



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There is a driver (hands on the keyboard) and a navigator (person who tells the driver "where to go/what to do"). The purpose of pair programming is to speed up the coding process and output cleaner, better code.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique used in agile software development where two developers (driver and navigator) each take turns writing and reviewing code. The driver takes direction from the navigator. The two switch roles often.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that either takes two parameters as an argument or returns a function as a result

2. Jest: A JS testing framework built by facebook; you can test your JS code with jest

3. Objects: Variables that can contain multiple values in the same argument

4. Method: a property containing a function definition

5. Classes: A template for JS objects; Allows you quickly assign objects to new objects
