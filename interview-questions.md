# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: test

  Researched answer: test



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a version control software. It lets multiple developers work on projects without putting said projects in jeopardy. Github is just a way to manage your project's "code history" in the cloud.

  Researched answer: Git is a software use to track changes (think snapshots) to assist teams of developers during software development. Github is a cloud-based way to manage your repositories.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Through my research I learned that the difference between Git and Github is indeed the fact that Git is local and Github is remote. To further go on detail, Git is a graphical user interface keeping track of your past actions retaining the source code during the software development process through your own local personal computer. Github in the other hand is a way you store your Git files via online, a service focused on centralizing source code with places in which codes are stored to a directory and essentially a hosting service that can be available or accessed to the public allowing you to share your Git and other Developers are able to pair program or work/alter on your Git codes remotely. - Arnold


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The JS operators that will return a Boolean value are <, >, =, <=, and >=.

  Researched answer: The following operators will all return a Boolean Value: <, >, ==, ===, <=, and >=. (Don't forget the &&, ||, and ! operators.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Logical operators, equality operators, and relational operators will return a boolean value. Logical operators include the and, or, and not which are denoted by &&, ||, and ! respectively. The logical && states that both sides of the statement must be true. The logical || states that at least one side of the statement must be true. The logical ! states that whatever the statement is, the ! will negate that and make it the opposite. Equality operators include the == and === which denote to 'loosely equal to' and 'strictly equal to', respectively. Lastly, relational operators include the >, <, >=, and <= which essentially tries to find a relationship between two values. - Athen



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the actual position something has in an array. Value is the actual value that thing holds.

  Researched answer: The index is the location, while the value is what is stored there. Index has number data type while the value can be ANY data type.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is code that will loop until the end of the code

  Researched answer: An iteration is when your code repeats a task until the condition is no longer met. Each time it repeats is called an iteration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The syllabus better defines iteration as "the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met." Further research shows me that For Loops and While Loops are a very common form of this, which makes sense. I initially thought if/else statements could be considered iteration on their own, but it seems like looping is required. If/else statements as I understand could have multiple steps, but the information is just being run through them once. - Kendra



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There is a driver (hands on the keyboard) and a navigator (person who tells the driver "where to go/what to do"). The purpose of pair programming is to speed up the coding process and output cleaner, better code.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique used in agile software development where two developers (driver and navigator) each take turns writing and reviewing code. The driver takes direction from the navigator. The two switch roles often.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Researched answer: Proper pair programming procedure involves two programmers working together at one workstation. One programmer has the role of the driver who writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles often.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that either takes two parameters as an argument or returns a function as a result

2. Jest: A JS testing framework built by facebook; you can test your JS code with jest

3. Objects: Variables that can contain multiple values in the same argument

4. Method: a property containing a function definition; JS methods are actions that can be performed on objects

5. Classes: A template for JS objects; Allows you quickly assign objects to new objects; Made of class declaratives and class expressions
